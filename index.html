                    I learned lots of hand skills here due to the store having 4 different food stations.

                    Had to work under a much more stressful environment than I am used to, especially during holidays and sports events. Taught me how to handle situations in a timely manner.

                    <li>
                        I also worked as a cook whenever needed to help the kitchen whether it be on the fryers, the line making pizzas/appetizers, or cutting and organizing the food.

                    <li>
                        During morning buffet hours at Pizza hut, I would help the manager and waitress seat people, clean the tables, and pay for their meals. I would find any way to help since they were the busiest hours.

                <li>
                    Since I was trusted enough to handle the special cleaning tools, I received a slight raise to become one of nightly baggers that cleaned around the store, helping each department take out their trash and by cleaning the bathrooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I became one of the top baggers to train new associates with their job. I would teach them how to bag groceries for the customers. I taught them my own tricks while also telling them where all the tools of a bagger was, like the paper bags when requested, what types of attitudes are always welcome, the rope cart pulling mechanism, and all the closest nearby cleaning stations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was usually the first-person customers saw when they walked in so to provide the best customer service to help them get in and get out as fast as possible while keeping them happy. Doing this was where I really learned how to work with people depending on the multiple attitudes anyone can have, no matter how angry they are, keep a smile and be nice and civil.

                            The Lost & Found was created to try and help the Aurora University campus try to track down any
                            items that could be reported "lost" or not. The site had a login that required credentials for either
                            an admin or a member to login, each having different pages to look at and different management capabilities
                            With the help of this site, if the campus wanted to use it, anybody with an account could report a stolen or found
                            item in any of the given locations on a regular school map!
